# WSL

This directory contains Bash specific configuration files which came bundled with Windows WSL.

I've included them here for posteriy, and in case any internal systems need to use Bash to operate correctly.

However, I have edited `bashrc` to trigger `Zsh` on login as a work around to set a "default" login shell.
